bfw creates an environment for bash 4.x scripting.

Much of the "icing" that many fail to include in their scripts, is included in the framework. Things like:

  * debug/trace interfaces
  * signal trapping
  * isolation of framework variables
  * usage/help/info/changelog tool
  * selective loading of source modules
  * restrict execution to selected users
  * documentation inside your scripts

and more.
